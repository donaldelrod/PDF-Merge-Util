# Java PDF Util

Tool to search folder trees and recursively add pictures to separate PDF files, or merge them all into one if that is desired. It handles pictures in folders, as well as files stored in .zip files. I wrote this when I was 16, before I learned any formal program design, so cut me some slack on the efficiency and poor form of the program.
